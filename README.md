## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m a Software Engineering student at the Instituto Federal do ParanÃ¡ (IFPR), currently in my third semester. I have a deep passion for computer science and software architecture.

Iâ€™m constantly exploring and learning new technologies, and I have a solid grasp of various programming languages, including Python, Java, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, and C#.

If youâ€™re interested in collaborative projects or just want to chat about technology and software development, feel free to reach out!

ðŸš€ Letâ€™s code together!
